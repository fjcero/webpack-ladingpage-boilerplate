# The Static Landing Page Boilerplate (Handlebars + Webpack)

Sometimes plain HTML just do the work.

What it supports:

- **Handlebars**: html splitting made easy.
- **PostCSS** (with SCSS syntax): manage your css with modern syntax
- **Optimize all your assets** to load in ludicrous mode in any hosting
- **Versioning** of assets, the magic of Webpack allows to prevent cache in critical files
- **Deploy** to Zeit (or any other static file serving CDN)

No JS framework. You can choose whatever you want, Web Components is the best option for the task.
